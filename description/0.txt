Hi, I would be very glad if someone can help me with algorithm to solve following task.
 
We have a convoy of cars that are lined up in a row and must cross the bridge. Cars canÂ´t overtake each other.
The bridge has limited capacity, which may not be exceeded.
Find the algorithm, which divides cars into groups so that the entire convoy cross the bridge in the shortest time.
Another group is allowed to enter only when the entire previous group cross the bridge.
Weight and speed of each car is known. The speed of group is determined by the slowest of car in the group.

Thank you. Gennady.
